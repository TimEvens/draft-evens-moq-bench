1.  Introduction

   [MOQT] specifies the client–server interactions and messaging used by
   clients and relays to fan-out published data to one or more
   subscribers.  Implementations employ several state machines to
   coordinate these interactions.  Relays must serialize and deserialize
   data objects and their extension headers when forwarding to
   subscribers.  Because [MOQT] runs over [QUIC], relay performance is
   directly affected by receive/send processing, encryption/decryption,
   and loss-recovery ACK handling.

   To evaluate relay performance under realistic conditions, this
   document defines a benchmarking methodology that mimics real-world
   use cases.

2.  Terminology

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in
   BCP 14 [RFC2119] [RFC8174] when, and only when, they appear in all
   capitals, as shown here.

   Commonly used terms in this document are described below.

   Track Configurations:  Track configurations define

   Config Profile:  A set of Track Configurations that are used to
      perform a series of tests to evaluate the performance of relays.

   Test Scenario:  A test scenario is a set of config profiles that are
      used to perform a series of tests to evaluate the performance of
      relays.

3.  Data Patterns

   Data transmission patterns are relative to the data that is being
   transmitted at the time of transmission.

3.1.  Video Media

   Video media is a common [MOQT] use case.  A video media track
   typically begins with a large data object, followed by a series of
   smaller data objects within the same group.  The initial object is
   often significantly larger than the subsequent ones.  Video is
   transmitted at regular intervals (e.g., every 33 ms for 30 fps),
   producing a bursty fan-out pattern at each interval.  Each data
   object commonly carries at least three extension headers.

   Video has a direct dependency on previous objects within a group.  If
   objects are lost in a group, it breaks the ability to render the
   video correctly.

   Video is often larger than MTU and cannot be transmitted as defined
   in [MOQT] using datagram.  Unless video is very low quality, video
   uses [QUIC] stream forwarding instead of datagram forwarding.

3.2.  Audio Media

   Audio media is a common [MOQT] use case.  An audio media track
   typically maintains fixed intervals with similarly sized data
   objects.  Like video, transmission occurs at each interval, producing
   a periodic fan-out burst.  Each data object usually carries fewer
   than three extension headers.

   [MOQT] does not define how to handle larger than MTU sized data
   objects for [QUIC] datagarms.  Audio does not have the same
   requirement as video where subsequent data objects are related to the
   previous object or group.

   Audio is a prime candidate for datagram considering the size of the
   data objects are less than MTU and there is no dependency on previous
   object within a group.

   Audio primarily uses [QUIC] datagrams for forwarding.

3.3.  Fetch

   A fetch in [MOQT] is similar to a retrieval of a file where the data
   will be sent all at once and not paced on an interval.  In [MOQT] the
   data will be sent using a single [QUIC] stream.  The data will be
   sent as fast as the receiver [QUIC] connection can receive it.

3.4.  Interactive Data

   Chat, metrics, and logging are use cases for interactive data.  This
   data is sent based on interaction, such as a human typing a message
   or metrics event, or logging event.  A unique characteristic of this
   data is that it is sent when needed and isn't always constant.
   Metrics might be an exception where metrics are sent at a constant
   interval, but metrics may also be sent based on a triggered event.

   Interactive data is often sent using [QUIC] streams but can also be
   sent via datagram considering the size of the data is often less than
   MTU size.

3.5.  Group and Subgroup Impact to Relays

   In [MOQT], when a group or subgroup changes a [QUIC] stream is
   created for the group/subgroup.  This results in additional state for
   the [MOQT] relay implementation to handle multiple groups/subgroups
   in-flight.  The data transmission use case drives how frequently
   groups/subgroups change, which can impact the performance of relays.
   Changing of group/subgroup is only impactful with [MOQT] stream
   tracks.

4.  Scenarios

   A combination of data patterns are used to define a scenario.  The
   scenario becomes a Config Profile.  Various data patterns are
   combined to define a scenario.  The scenario (Config Profile) is used
   to benchmark a relay.

   Below describes common scenarios that the benchmark and configuration
   profiles need to support.  Other scenarios can be defined as needed
   using the configuration profiles.

4.1.  Single Publisher to Multiple Subscribers - Audio

                             ┌──────────────┐

          └──────────────┘    └──────────────┘   └──────────────┘

   The above diagram shows a single publisher sending audio to multiple
   subscribers.

   A single audio track is published using datagram.  The audio track is
   sent at a constant interval that is then sent to all subscribers.
   The benchmark is to see how many subscribers can be supported by the
   relay using datagram forwarding.

4.2.  Single Publisher to Multiple Subscribers - Audio and Video

                             ┌──────────────┐

          │ Subscriber 1 │    │ Subscriber 2 │   │ Subscriber 3 │
          └──────────────┘    └──────────────┘   └──────────────┘

   The above diagram shows a single publisher sending audio and video to
   multiple subscribers.

   Two tracks are published, an audio datagram track and a reliable
   stream track for video.  The benchmark is to see how many subscribers
   can be supported by the relay using both datagram and stream
   forwarding tracks.

           └─────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘

   The above diagram shows a set of publishers and subscribers.  Each
   client in this scenario publishes two tracks, audio and video, and
   subscribe to the other subscribers audio and video tracks.  In this
   scenario, the set of publishers and subscribers mimic a video
   conference meeting.  The benchmark is to see how many sets (aka
   meetings) can be supported by the relay using datagram and stream
   forwarding tracks.

5.  Methodology

5.1.  Config Profile

   A configuration profile consists of per track configuration settings.
   The following track settings are defined:

   +===================+===============================================+
   | Field             | Notes                                         |
   +===================+===============================================+
   | namespace         | Namespace tuple of the track                  |
   +-------------------+-----------------------------------------------+
   | name              | Name of the track                             |
   +-------------------+-----------------------------------------------+
   | mode              | Mode is either datagram or stream             |
   +-------------------+-----------------------------------------------+
   | priority          | Priority of the track                         |
   +-------------------+-----------------------------------------------+
   | ttl               | Time to live for objects published            |
   +-------------------+-----------------------------------------------+
   | interval          | Interval in milliseconds to send data objects |
   +-------------------+-----------------------------------------------+
   | Objects Per       | Number of objects within a group              |
   | Group             |                                               |
   +-------------------+-----------------------------------------------+
   | First             | First object of group size in bytes           |
   | Object Size       |                                               |
   +-------------------+-----------------------------------------------+
   | Remaining         | Remaining objects of group size in bytes      |
   | Object Size       |                                               |
   +-------------------+-----------------------------------------------+
   | Duration          | Duration in milliseconds to send data objects |
   +-------------------+-----------------------------------------------+
   | Start Delay       | Start delay in milliseconds                   |
   +-------------------+-----------------------------------------------+

                      Table 1: Textual NodeId Formats

   Interpolation can be used to template the configuration profile.

   Upon start, the track will start off with "First Object Size" of data
   bytes.  Subsequent objects will use the Remaining Object Size in
   bytes.  The remaining objects sent will be Objects Per Group number
   minus the first object.  For example, if Objects Per Group is 10 and
   First Object Size is 100 bytes and Remaining Object Size is 50 bytes,
   then the first group will be 100 bytes and the remaining 9 groups
   will be 50 bytes each.

   Groups value will increment based on sending Objects Per Group number
   of objects.  TTL is used to define how long published objects should
   remain in the transmit queue.

   Objects will be published at the Interval value.

   Objects and groups will continue for as long as the Duration value.

5.2.  Synchronize Start of Benchmark

   Synchronization of the benchmark is required to ensure that all
   clients start at the same time as the publisher so that objects
   published can be compared to objects received.

   To synchronize the start of the benchmark, the publisher will publish
   a START message repeatedly for the duration of Start Delay value in
   milliseconds.  The START message will be published every every 1/10th
   interval of the Start Delay value in milliseconds.

   Clients will subscribe to the published track and will wait for the
   START message to be received.  If the start message is not received
   before data messages or completion message, the track benchmark is
   considered failed.

   Clients will ignore the repeated START messages after receiving the
   first one.  The test begins on the first DATA message received.
   START MUST not be sent after sending the first DATA message.

5.3.  Completion of benchmark

   The per track benchmark is completed when the publisher sends a
   COMPLETION message.  The COMPLETION message will be sent after the
   last DATA message is sent.

5.4.  Messages

   Testing utilizes various messages to start testing, send data, and
   report metrics on completion.

   The following messages are defined:

5.4.1.  START

   START Message {
     type (8) = 0x01,
     objects_per_group (uint32),
     first_object_size (uint32),
     remaining_object_size (uint32),
     interval (uint32),
   }

                        Figure 1: Start Test Message

5.4.2.  DATA

   DATA Message {
     type (8) = 0x02,
     objects_per_group (uint32),
     first_object_size (uint32),
     remaining_object_size (uint32),
     duration (uint32),
   }

                           Figure 2: Data Message

5.4.3.  COMPLETION

   COMPLETION Message {
     type (8) = 0x03,
     objects_sent (uint64),
     groups_sent (uint64),
     duration (uint32),
   }

                        Figure 3: Completion Message

5.5.  Running Benchmark

   The configuration profile is used, often with interpolation, to run
   multiple instances of clients connections to the relay.
